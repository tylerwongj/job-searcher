  I'm looking for a software engineering role where I can work with modern technologies
  and contribute to meaningful projects. I prefer companies with good work-life balance,
  opportunities for growth, and collaborative team environments. I'm particularly 
  interested in roles that involve API development, cloud technologies, and working
  with data. Remote work or hybrid options are preferred.
